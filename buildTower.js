/*
Write a function that takes in a number. It should return a “tower” of *. The tower will be an array of strings.

The number passed in tells you how many floors the tower should have.

The first floor should have 1 block, the 2nd should have 3 blocks, the 3rd should have 5 blocks, and so on.

Each block is represented by a *.

For example, a tower of 3 floors looks like this (note the spacing):

[
    '  *  ',
    ' *** ',
    '*****'
]
and a tower of 6 floors looks like this:

[
    '     *     ',
    '    ***    ',
    '   *****   ',
    '  *******  ',
    ' ********* ',
    '***********'
]
*/

function towerBuilder(num) {
    array = [];


}


console.log(tower(1));
console.log(tower(6));
